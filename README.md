Scrapping Data
===

In order to re-collect raw data you need to have the framework scrapy installed (http://scrapy.org/). Once that is done replace the items.py and spiders.py files with the ones provided in this repo. There are 4 working spider(DuProp, DuPropSold, RoyalHouse, RoyalCondo). Run "scrapy crawl [SPIDER NAME]" to collect the data (use options to save to csv).
